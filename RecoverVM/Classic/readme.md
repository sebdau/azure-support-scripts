# Overview
Occasionally Azure IaaS VMs may not start because there is something wrong with the operating system (OS) disk preventing it from booting up correctly.
In such cases it is a common practice to recover the problem VM by performing the following steps:

- Delete the VM (but keep the disks)
- Attach the disk(s) to another bootable VM as a Data Disk
- Fix the disk manually.
- Detach the disk and recreate the original VM using the recovered operating system disk

> the full details on this recovery process are explained in this blog post:
